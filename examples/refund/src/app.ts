/**
 * Proof example: a payment refund action governed by @irogane/kaji.
 *
 * This file answers the questions a developer evaluating the package
 * would ask: what do I wrap, where does my business logic stay, how do I
 * identify the caller, how do approvals work, where does the idempotency
 * key come from, what happens on a duplicate request, and what happens
 * when a remote side effect may have succeeded but the response is lost.
 *
 * Everything above the `capability()`/`createKaji()` calls is ordinary
 * application code. Kaji only governs the boundary between a request and
 * `payments.refund()` actually running.
